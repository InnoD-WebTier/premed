            description: 'Sometimes it\'s helpful to have an experienced student\'s perspective on how to juggle classes, study, manage time, choose the best enrichment opportunities, or how to navigate the waters of a large university like Cal. In cases like this, ESS Peer Advisers are an amazing resource! They can also assist in answering questions like how to drop a class or choose an elective, and can tell you all about life in their particular major, (and COE in general!). ESS Peer Advisers provide general information to engineering undergraduates regarding university and college requirements and procedures. This includes information about registration, deadlines, research and leadership opportunities, student organizations, campus resources and special events. Peer Advisers also meet with prospective students and lead workshops throughout the semester.'
