                                Undergraduate Advisors have a special role on campus — they are a link between faculty and students and between students and campus. Advisors are your “tour guides” to student services and academic information in departments and across campus. Advisors have access to all the online registration and transcript information that you need. If questions or problems arise, they are trained to assist you in understanding campus policy. All issues discussed between students and Advisors are confidential. You can contact your Advisor about any questions you may have.

                                The work of peer advisors is integral to the success of their fellow CNR undergraduates. Peer advisors are trained in understanding CNR and university requirements, policies, and procedures, and they help with CNR recruitment and enrichment programs.

                            "This is a personal project of mine. I'm am a Cal alum from 2007, who is now in the process of completing medical school at UCSF. Looking back I feel like I was completely lost at Cal, with really poor advising and nobody to go to. I'm hoping this group can be a collection of my thoughts and advice that I have learned the hard way to become a doctor. I hope it will be helpful to whoever is interested in medicine - too often I feel that those who make it into medicine are actually those with the greatest potential to be doctors, but those people who just had better advice, or knew how the game works. My hope is to level the playing field a bit. Also, if you message me, please friend me (acquaintance is fine) since FB seems to think the high volume of messages I send to non-friended people is spam and has blocked me. You can also friend or follow me to see what sort of health/medicine/tech stuff I read (and I read a lot). You are also welcome to invite anyone else who is a premed to this group."
